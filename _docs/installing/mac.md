Installing MusicBot on Mac requires several libraries and applications. First, install Python 3.5+ on your system. For the best results, install [Python 3.5.4](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.4/python-3.5.4-macosx10.6.pkg) (double-click the pkg file to install). Next, you will need to open Terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
# Install Homebrew
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew update
xcode-select --install

# Install dependencies
brew install git
brew install ffmpeg
brew install opus
brew install libffi
brew install libsodium

# Clone the MusicBot
cd desktop
git clone https://github.com/Just-Some-Bots/MusicBot.git MusicBot -b master 

# Install Python dependencies
cd MusicBot
python3 -m pip install -U pip
python3 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

After this, you can find a folder called `MusicBot` on your Desktop. You can then open it, [configure]({{ site.baseurl }}/using/configuration) your bot, and then run the bot by double-clicking the `run.sh` file. If you can't run this, you may have to open Terminal, cd to the folder, and use `chmod +x run.sh` to give the file executable permissions.
